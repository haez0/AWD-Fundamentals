<h1>4 Fundamentals of Programming</h1>
<section>
  <p>This page focuses on the fundamental ideas of JavaScript programming. 
    It shows how input and output promote user interaction, 
    how variables are used to store and manage data, and how conditionals 
    enable decisions to be made in response to particular conditions. 
    It also demonstrates looping, which enables efficient task repetition 
    until a predetermined condition is satisfied. 
    These illustrations offer a concise and useful grasp of the fundamentals of JavaScript.</p>

        you can assign and modify values while the program is running by 
        declaring variables in programming using particular keywords like var, let, and const in JavaScript.
